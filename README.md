# Wordly

A basic Wordle clone, differences are:
- Word can be 4-6 letters with spaces at the end
- A single letter is given at the beginning as a clue
- No daily words, words are chosen at random with infinite new games
- An admin panel that lets you add or remove words from the dictionary or set the current word

Built with [bun](bun.sh), run the program with:
```
git clone https://github.com/bodhiahn/wordly.git
cd wordly
```
```
bun install
```
```
bun dev
```
